# git-merged-branches

Use this plugin to see which branches have been merged into your branch! But exclude anything that is already in `main`

To use this, clone the repo into ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/

```
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/Zacharyjlo/git-merged-branches
```

And then edit your .zshrc file and add `git-merged-branches` to your oh my zsh plugins.

Use the alias `mb` to then see the merged branches
